# Lesson 5 Project
You’re starting to get into the meat of HTML, learning how to format pages using CSS. You’ll use inline CSS in this lesson to demonstrate color methods, fonts, and font families. Think about how the styles you apply will appear to a user, keeping in mind that this page in your portfolio will demonstrate that you know how to apply styles, as well as that you understand why you’ve made your styling choices.

## Project Prep
1. If you haven't done so already, clone the repo to your computer within your course folder.
2. Open the repo within VS Code. You can open this `readme.md` file within VS Code to view the project directions there. 

   > **TIP:** Right click on the file and choose the `Open Preview` option.
3. If there are files and folders present other than this `readme.md` file, take some time to familiarize yourself with the files within the repo so you know where they are located. This will help you when asked to use them within the project directions.

   > **TIP:** Before beginning any work on the project, read through all the steps to understand what you will be doing.

Beginning with this lesson, you will no longer be given specific points at which to save, sync, and apply commits to your work. It is now up to you to do this regularly throughout your project at the points that you determine. You will also need to write appropriate commit messages. If you are unsure about this, contact your Instructor.

## Part 1: Create an Inline CSS Page
1. Open the **template.html** file.
2. Copy the template.html file and rename the copied file as `inline_css.html`. The file should be in the same folder as the template.html folder. 
3. In the Head section, update the **multi-line comment** as needed to match the information for this lesson. 
4. In the Head section, update the **metadata** with the following information:
    1. Update the page **title** to follow this format: **{FirstName}'s Inline CSS Page**
    > Replace **{FirstName}** with your actual first name, for example: **Mica's Inline CSS Page**.
    2. Add your first and last name as the **author**.
    3. Add a minimum of **5 keywords** appropriate for the page content.
    4. Add an appropriate **description**.
    > Use the best practices you learned in Lesson 4 about metadata to match the purpose of this page: to demonstrate different CSS styles.
    
5. In the header section, update the **first-level heading** to read: **Applying Inline CSS**
6. In the header section, add your **Inspirational Quote** that you chose in lesson 4.
7. In the header section, comment out the **NAV element**.
8. In the Main section, edit the placeholder content so that there are **two (2) paragraphs** with a **second level-heading** above each paragraph. Edit the placeholder text with the following information:
    1. In the first paragraph, briefly explain the difference between the generic font families.
    2. In the second paragraph, briefly explain the different ways that you can indicate color on a web page or in text. 
    3. Add appropriate text for each second-level heading that appropriately summarizes each paragraph.
9. In the Footer section, update YourName with your actual name, and the copyright year to the current year (if necessary).

***Have you saved and synced your work lately? Now would be a good time to do so!***

## Part 2: Apply Inline CSS
Apply CSS directly to the appropriate HTML element to complete the following steps.
    
1. Center align *all elements* within the **header**. Do this with the least number of inline styles as possible. 
2. Style the **first-level heading** within a single declaration block based upon the following criteria:    
    1. Apply a color of your choosing using the hexadecimal method.
    2. Change the font size using an absolute value.
    3. Apply a family of fonts.
3. Add an **HTML comment** before the first-level heading to explain what would happen if the first font listed is not available to the end user, using your selected fonts as a guide.
4. Modify the font weight of the **inspirational quote paragraph** within the page header to make it bold in appearance.
5. Add an **HTML comment** before the slogan paragraph to identify all three types of values that can be used to define a font-weight property.
6. For each of the **second-level headings**:
    1. Apply a color of your choosing to the first heading using the color names method.
    2. Apply a color of your choosing to the second heading using the RGB method.
7. For the first **paragraph** within the main section, use the **font shorthand** property to:
    1. Increase the font size using a relative value.
    2. Apply a set of sans-serif styled fonts.
8. For the second **paragraph** within the main section, use the **font shorthand** property to:
    1. Apply a font style.
    2. Increase the font size by applying a value of the length in pixels.
    3. Apply a set of monospace styled fonts.
9. Right align *all elements* within the **footer**. Do this with the least number of inline styles as possible.

   > **TIP:** If you need a refresher on how to submit your work, view: [Submitting Assignments & Viewing Feedback](https://riosalado.coursearc.com/content/cis-public/git-github-and-vs-code/submitting-assignments-and-viewing-feedback).
1. Review your work and make any necessary updates. Save the file. You can either select **FILE>SAVE** or use the keyboard shortcut **CTRL+S**.
2. **Sync** the changes and apply a final **Commit** that says: `Completed final review and updates before submission.`
3. Verify that all files appear on GitHub.

   > **TIP:** You can view any of your repos by going to the GitHub organization for the course - [RSC-CIS133DA-IN-V12 Organization](https://github.com/rsc-cis133DA-in-v12). Once you are viewing the class organization, you should see all of the Repos that you have accepted assignment invitations for. It is recommended that you bookmark this page for future reference. Push (i.e., sync) the files on your computer with GitHub to ensure all files are uploaded to GitHub for your instructor to view.
4. Right-click the link to your repository and select **Copy Link Address**.
5. Go to the Assessing Your Learning page in your RioLearn lesson, and click the link to submit the assignment. Paste the link to your repo in the assignment submission box.
